# toDoList-App
to do list app

A simple todo list app built in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
The first version was built following a tutorial by Dev Ed, link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttf3CEsEwMQ&t=72s. After that changes were made by me to make it
more complex. 
Changes made:
Added the table which takes user input, creates a new row and assign values to celss;
Cells can be selected and deselected;
Selected cells can be marked completed, important or deleted;
Media queries for mobile and tablet;
Creating background image.
